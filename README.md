This is a practice snippet, implementing and adding further, on @freecodecamp's project on [How to build an HTML calculator app from scratch using javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98)

Branch "byRinidh" is my initial trial to accomplish the project. Please see branch "byFreeCodeCamp" for original code

> Note that this project is not available at freecodecamp's open source codebase at github
